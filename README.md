# Smalltalk-80 by the Book

The Smalltalk-80 book series published by Xerox Parc in the early 80s was the culminating point of an incredibly productive decade of research that gave birth to most of the hardware and software inventions and concepts of the IT world as we know it today.

One particular book in the series titled "Smalltalk-80 The language and its implementation" authored by Adele Goldberg and Dave Robson quickly became so famous in the computer science community that it was given a nick name, the "Blue Book", referring to the color of its cover.

In 600 pages, the book covers the complete Smalltalk-80 programming system comprising the specification of the Smalltalk-80 language (at the origin of most of today's fully object oriented programming languages), a comprehensice and reflective object model, a rich set of standard libraries (or classes), the description of a full graphic environment and UI interactions and some sample applications. But as this wasn't enough, a fourth part was added to the book explaining how to reimplement on the harwdware platform of your choice the virtual machine and with run the entire programming environment as described in the Blue Book.

As a testimonial to the power of the Smalltalk language, the virtual machine was entirely specified in the book using Smalltalk itself.
