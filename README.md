# Smalltalk-80 by the Book

This project is about delivering the promise of a book written in the eighties : run the complete Smalltalk-80 environment as published by Xerox Parc in 1983 only using the Smalltalk language itself. Want to know more about the background and the objectives of this project? Read our [bits of history](History.md).

# Seeing is believing
But does it actually work ? the answer is yes it does :-) Here is a screenshot of the VM fully written in Smalltalk running in my Smalltalk Pharo environment. The Smalltalk-80 screen that you see is the exact same screen as the one presented in the 1983 Blue Book. using your won machine keyboard and mous you can interact with the environment: browse the class hierachy and its sources, execute some Smalltalk-80 code in a Workspace, etc..
