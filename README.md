# Smalltalk-80 by the Book

This project is about delivering the promise of the book "Smalltalk-80 The Language and its Implementation" (aka the "Blue Book") as published by Xerox Parc in 1983. That is implementing and running the complete Smalltalk-80 VM environment using only the Smalltalk language itself. Want to know more about the background of this project? Read our [bits of history](History.md).

Disclaimer: this project is still very much work in progress.  I welcome all contributions be it bug reports, code fixes, improved documentation...

# Installation
* Install the Smalltalk [Pharo](https://www.pharo.org/) environment
* Run the Pharo launcher, install the Pharo 11 image and launch it.
* Click on the `Sources > Git repositories browser` menu and then the "+ Add" button
* Choose the "Clone remote repository" option
* In the Remote URL field  copy-paste this git repo URL  : `https://github.com/ljulliar/smalltalk-80-sources.git`and select the local directory of your choice where to clone the git repo.
* Click on the ` Browse > Playground` menu
* In the Playground window type `ST80VirtualMachine run`. Right click and Do It. Et voil√†!

# Smalltalk-80 at work
But does it actually work ? the answer is yes it does :-) As seeing is believing, here is a screenshot of the ST-80 VM running for real in my Smalltalk Pharo environment.

The Smalltalk-80 startup screen that you see here is exactly as presented in the 1983 Blue Book. Notice the date of the VM image in the System Transcript window. Using your own machine keyboard and mouse you can interact with the environment: browse the class hierachy and its sources, execute some Smalltalk-80 code in a Workspace...

# Credits
I'd like to thank a number of people whose prior work made this project possible:
* The [Pharo](https://www.pharo.org/) developers community for providing this remarkable Open Source Smalltalk environment
* [Dan Banay's Smalltalk-80 VM] project that proved very helpful to fix the bugs in the Smalltak code originally published in the Blue Book
* Eliot Miranda for providing in plain text the [5 chapters of the Blue Book](http://www.mirandabanda.org/bluebook/bluebook_imp_toc.html) dedicated to the Smalltalk-80 specifications.
* And last but not the least, [Mario Wolczko ST-80 web page](http://www.wolczko.com/st80/) for putting together critical files that one absolutely needs to run the full Smalltalk environment, most notably the Virtual Machine image as published (on tapes !!) by Xerox Parc in 1983.
