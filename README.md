# Smalltalk-80 by the Book

This project is about delivering the promise of the  book "Smalltalk-80 The Language and its Implemenentation"  (aka the "BLue Book") as published by Xerox Parc in 1983. That is implementing and running the complete Smalltalk-80 VM environment using only the Smalltalk language itself. Want to know more about the background  of this project? Read our [bits of history](History.md).Disclaimer: this project is still very much work in progress.  I welcome all your contributions be it bug reports, code fixes, improved documentation...

# Smalltalk-80 at work
But does it actually work ? the answer is yes it does :-) As seeing is believing, here is a screenshot of the VM running for real in my Smalltalk Pharo environment. ![Screenshot of the ST-80 VM startup screen ) ](images/ST80-startup-screen.png)The Smalltalk-80 screen that you see is the exact same screen as the one presented in the 1983 Blue Book. Using your own machine keyboard and mouse you can interact with the environment: browse the class hierachy and its sources, execute some Smalltalk-80 code in a Workspace, etc..
