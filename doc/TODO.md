# Contributing to the project

So you feel brave enough to contribute to this project ? :wink: And help revive this remarkable Smalltalk-80 programming environment ? Here are some suggestions for you:

- [ ] (Easy) Improve the documentation! Typically a never ending task as you know... For instance add a documentation file to explain the basics of how to use the Smalltalk-80 environment (how to use the scrollbars, the workspace, how to edit or execute code,...) or a document on the architecture of this projet (The VM, the ST80 proxy classes, the HAL,...)
- [ ] (Intermediate) Write a UI interface to launch and stop the VM (select image path, keyboard layout, possibly the screen size,...
- [ ] (Intermediate) Add more keyboard layouts mapping to the HardwareAbstractionLayer class
- [ ] (Easy) Test the Smalltalk-80 environment like manipulating windows, executing some sample code and report any VM exception or wrong result

Implement the missing features of the VM. For instance:
- [ ] The Filesystem primitives
- [ ] The accelerated CharacterScanner primitives and function on the host side
- [ ] Make the execution of the DisplayScreen dispayExtent:  work (see sample code int he ST-80 System Workspace window)
- [ ] Save a snapshot of the Smalltalk 80 environment (right click on the desktop background and select 'save')
- [ ] and many others!
